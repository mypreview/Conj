?> Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](adding-block).

## Block Interface

Each block comes with unique toolbar icons and specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

### Adding Images

Upon adding the cover block, you have two options to chose from, **Upload** and **Media Library**. The upload button allows you to upload a new image from your device and media library allows you to select an image you’ve already uploaded to your site’s media library.

### Edit Image

This is the secondary option in the cover block’s toolbar. Choosing this will enable you to select a new image file for your block. You may use this if you need to replace the already existing image file in your cover block.

### Alignment

Similar to most of the blocks, you can align the cover block itself to the **left**, **right**, and **center** from the toolbar. Also, using the left or right alignment enables you to place another block beside the cover block.

In addition to what mentioned above, some of the blocks have a **wide** and **full-width** alignment that is useful for creating unique headers and widescreen effects. These two options are mostly available if the specific block supports this kind of alignments.

## Sidebar Settings

In addition to the options found in the block’s toolbar, you may locate the block specific settings in the **editor sidebar panel**. Clicking on the **cog** icon next to the publish button will toggle the visibility of this panel.

## Fixed Background

Within the block settings panel on the sidebar, you have several other options to modify this block, the first of which is a toggle for a **Fixed Background**. 
Enabling this toggle field allows the cover block to fix the position of the image while user scrolls along with your page, nevertheless leaving this toggle off embeds the image in block’s wrapper, so the image doesn’t scroll.

## Overlay Color

The following option allows you to add a color overlay to the cover image. By default, this is a gray, transparent overlay, but with the overlay color options, you can switch that color to any other color of your choice.

## Background Opacity

The range slider allows you to set the opacity of the cover image’s overlay. Moving the slider up toward 100 makes the overlay darker and muddier, and moving it down toward 0 makes the overlay lighter and more transparent. At **100**, the overlay is entirely **dark**, and the cover image is no longer visible. At **0**, the overlay **disappears** completely, leaving only your image.

?> This setting is useful if you are using a visually noisy background image and finding the text in the cover block difficult to read.

## Advanced

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and apply styles to the block as you see fit.
