## Block Interface

Each block comes with unique toolbar icons and specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

## Adding Images

Upon adding the cover block, you have two options to chose from, Upload and Media Library. The Upload button allows you to upload a new image from your device and Media Library allows you to select an image you’ve already uploaded to your site’s Media Library.

## Edit Image

This is the secondary option in the cover block’s toolbar. Choosing this will enable you to select a new image file for your block. You may use this if you need to replace the already existing image file in your cover block.
