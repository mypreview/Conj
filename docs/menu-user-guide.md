## Creating Multi-level Menus

When planning the structure of your menu, it helps to think of each menu item as a heading in a formal report document.

The WordPress menu editor allows you to create multi-level menus using a simple **drag and drop** interface. Once an item is added to a menu, those menu items can be rearranged to create sub menu items. To create a drop down menu drag a menu item slightly to the right of the menu item above it to create a sub item (parent/child) relationship in the menu.

1. Position the mouse over the **child** menu item.
2. Whilst holding the left mouse button, drag it to the right.
3. Release the mouse button.
4. Repeat these steps for each sub-menu item.
5. Click the **Save Menu** button in the Menu Editor to save your changes.

?> You can also click the down arrow to reveal more information and there click the **Up one**, **Down one**, **Under item above it**, and **To the top**.
