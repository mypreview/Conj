# Find a Page or Post ID in WordPress

In WordPress, every single page or post has an ID associated to it. Pages, tags, categories, menus, etc. all have IDâ€™s which is how they are referenced and saved in the database. 

Locating an ID of any post or page in WordPress is fairly simple, and there are different ways and even plugins that can be used but the easiest method is to go to the edit screen of your page and look at the URL where you will be able to locate the ID in the format `post=ID`.
