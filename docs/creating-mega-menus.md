# Creating Mega Menus

This feature allows you to transform any top-level primary menu item into a full-width dropdown mega-menu.

The easy to use drag & drop interface enables you to add any content you wish **up to 6 per row** using Widgets that can be rearranged and resized to display in your site navigation area.

?> Currently, Mega Menus only works in the **Primary Menu** [location](menu-user-guide?id=assigning-your-menu-to-a-location), which is the main navigation under your logo.

## Configuring a Mega Menu

Follow the steps below to create an example mega-menu:

1. On the frontend, in the **Admin bar**, click **Customize**.
2. On the backend, click **Appearance** Â» **Customize**.
3. Navigate to Export/Import section.
4. Select the menu which is currently set to **Primary Menu**.
5. Click on the **arrow** icon in the top right-hand corner of the menu item to expand it.
6. Click the **Mega Menu** button to open a new side panel where you can manage the selected menu item(s).
7. Click the **Add a Widget** button to search and select a new widget from the list to add.

?> [Text Widget](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets#Adding_Code_to_the_Text_Widget) plugin enables you to embed any standard WooCommerce shortcodes to the menu item and display them as a result.
