# Creating Mega Menus

This feature allows you to transform any top-level primary menu item into a full-width dropdown mega-menu.

The easy to use drag & drop interface enables you to add any content you wish up to 6 per row using Widgets that can be rearranged and resized to display in your site navigation area.

?> Currently, Mega Menus only works in the **Primary Menu** [location](menu-user-guide?id=assigning-your-menu-to-a-location), which is the main navigation under your logo.
