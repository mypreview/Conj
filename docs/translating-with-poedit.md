## PO and MO translation files

WordPress uses PO and MO files to manage translations. In fact, WordPress only needs MO files to handle translations.

PO files are human-readable; Those files contains a list of strings ready to be translated or with a translation already included.

MO files just compiled exports from the PO files and used by WordPress to get the conversion of each string to translate the theme. If you try to open a MO file with a regular text editor, you will not understand anything of its content.

## Files that enable translation

*.pot: This file is a portable object template that contains all of the text to be translated.
*.po: The portable object file contains the original text and the translations.
*.mo: This is the machine object file. When your translation is complete, you will convert or export your .po file to this file type so that WordPress can use it.
