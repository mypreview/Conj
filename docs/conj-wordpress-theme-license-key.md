# License key

It’s strongly recommended that you add your theme’s license key from within the License section of the WordPress dashboard widget. By adding your key, you will activate the remote theme updates for as long as your license key is valid.

!> Please note that licenses are only given for [Conj Pro](https://www.mypreview.one/conj.html) - NOT the **Lite of Free** version.
