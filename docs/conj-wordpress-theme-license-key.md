# License key

It’s strongly recommended that you add your theme’s license key from within the License section of the WordPress dashboard widget. By adding your key, you will activate the remote theme updates for as long as your license key is valid.

!> Please note that licenses are only given for [Conj Pro](https://www.mypreview.one/conj.html) - NOT the **Lite of Free** version.

It is important to keep your license up to date in order to continue getting updates for your [CONJ WordPress theme](https://www.mypreview.one/conj.html) and support for any issues you may encounter. Renewing your license grants you access to  free updates for another year, including all updates for bug fixes and feature introductions.

?> Without a valid theme license, you will be unable to get support and auto-update notifications will not function.

If your key is not activated after hitting the **Register** button, simply refresh the WordPress dashboard and try again. Sometimes it takes a second or two try to properly establish a connection with the activation server.

## Activation instruction

To enable receiving automatic and one-click updates, locate the **CONJ THEME LICENSE** widget on your WordPress dashboard page, then enter your license key *(located in your purchase receipt)* into the text field.

?> Once your license key is activated, whenever a new update is released you will be notified in WordPress themes and dashboard page about it.

## Transfer license key

When you purchase CONJ, your license key entitles you to activate theme license on one WordPress setup only. If you wish to transfer your license key to another site, you will need to **unregister** or **revoke** CONJ license from your old WordPress site before deleting or uninstalling the theme or setup.
