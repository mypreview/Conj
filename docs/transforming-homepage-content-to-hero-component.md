# Transforming Homepage Content To A Hero Component

Adding a featured image to your homepage will automatically create a **hero component**. The featured image will be used as a background and your homepage content will be overlaid on top of it.

Hero components are more effective than sliders in terms of aesthetics. and you don’t have to keep using sliders if it’s slowing down your site.
