## Randomize Header Images

The **Current Header** image upload field will display only the currently active header image. However, you can upload a few more images to show a variety of random images in your site header area.

Once you have uploaded a few images, they will appear under **Previously Uploaded** section. You can click on the **Randomize uploaded headers** button which allows WordPress to choose one of the uploaded images for your header area randomly.
