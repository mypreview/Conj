# Create a page

Pages are generally for non-chronological, hierarchical content: pages like **About** or **Contact** would be common examples.

* Click the **Pages** tab.
* Click the **Add New** sub-tab.
* Start filling in the blanks: enter your **page title** in the upper field, and enter your **page body** content in the main page editing box below it.
* Optionally, you can choose or upload a **featured image** for your page.
