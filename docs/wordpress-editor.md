# WordPress Editor

Within the [WordPress version 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/) release, the entire editing experience of the posts and pages have been rebuilt to offer a genuine solution for creating media-rich content and control the adjustment of your layout with ease.

The editor takes all the worrying about the alignment and organization of content, quotes, and images, etc. and offers a flexible experience based on blocks so you can focus on creating engaging content instead.
