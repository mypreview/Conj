# Creating A Site-Wide Notice

**Store Notice** allows you to enter a site-wide message shown to everyone visiting your store. The message can be:

* **Informational** – A note that notifies customers of shipping delays due to weather conditions or an away notice if you are on vacation.
* **Promotional** – A note advertising an event, a holiday special, a bundle, a sale on all/some items or free shipping.
