# Adding And Managing Products

In the process of building your webshop, you will reach a point when you will need to add some products. This should be one of the main activities in your checklist after you perform the basic configuration of your store or after you installed and activated the [Conj - eCommerce WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/conj-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/21935639?ref=mypreview).

## Product Categories

Product **categories** and **tags** work in much the same way as normal categories and tags you have when writing posts in WordPress. They can be created, edited, and selected at any time. This can be done when you first create a product or editing it.

## Product Types

There are several sorts of products that you can add to your online shop using WooCommerce. When adding a product, the first thing to decide is what type of product it is:

* **Simple**
<br/>*This is a single physical product that has no variations.*
* **Virtual**
<br/>*An example of this would be a service, such as hourly consulting.*
* **Downloadable**
<br/>*This is both virtual and downloadable, such as an ebook or a music file.*
* **Grouped**
<br/>*A collection of products that are related but can be purchased separately. An example would be different models of the iMac from Apple.*
* **External or Affiliate**
<br/>*A product your will add to your store but buyers will be sent to another site to purchase it. Affiliates work well or products you may make a commission on.*
* **Variable**
<br/>*Some products will have different variations and multiple images. For example a t-shirt, that comes in different sizes and colors, with different prices.*

?> Other types are often added by extensions. For example, [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) adds new product types as does [WooCommerce Bookings](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/).

## Adding a Simple Product

Adding a Simple product is similar to writing a post in WordPress.

Follow the steps below to publish your first WooCommerce product:

![Adding a Simple Product](img/adding-simple-product.png)

1. Login to the your WordPress Dashboard.
2. Click the **Products** tab.
3. Click the **Add New** sub-tab.
4. Enter a product **Title** and **Description**.
5. Navigate to the **Product Data** panel, and select downloadable (digital) or virtual (service) if applicable.
6. Optionally, upload a featured image for your product.
7. When you are ready, click **Publish**.

!> Note that virtual products don’t require shipping — an order with virtual products won’t calculate shipping costs.

## Adding a Virtual Product

When adding a simple product, you can optionally check the **Virtual** checkbox in the product type panel. This removes unnecessary fields, such as dimensions.

## Adding a Downloadable Product

When adding a simple product, you can check the downloadable box in the product type panel. This adds two new fields:

* **File path** — Path or URL to your downloadable file.
* **Download limit** – Limit on number of times the customer can download file.<br/>*Left blank for unlimited downloads.*

For maximum flexibility, downloadable products also incur a shipping cost as an example if you were offering both a packaged and a downloadable version of a product, this would be ideal.

?> You can also check the **Virtual** checkbox if the downloadable product is not shippable.

## Adding a Grouped Product

When creating your **Grouped Product**, you will see that the General tab no longer exists. That’s because you are creating a grouped product that will have several simple products added to it. So in reality, it’s not an actual single product to purchase.

![Adding a Grouped Product](img/adding-grouped-product.png)

You need to go down to **Linked Products** tab and add the products to this group using the **Grouped products** field.

## Adding a External Or Affiliate Product

When you create this product, you will be sending your customers to an external site to purchase it, so both **Inventory** and **Shipping** have been removed. Then, under the **General** tab, you will find settings for the URL or link to send customers to make the purchase.

## Adding a Variable Product

Variable products are arguably the most complex of product types. They let you define variations of a single product where each variation may have a different SKU, price or stock level.

See [Variable Product](http://docs.woocommerce.com/?p=281) for a guide on creating a product with variations.

## Duplicating a Product

To save time, it’s possible to use a product and duplicate it to create similar products with variations and other qualities.

Navigate to **Products** » **All Products** and look through the list for a product you wish to replicate, then click **Duplicate**.

3. Click the **All Products** sub-tab.
