# Adding And Managing Products


## Product Types

There are several sorts of products that you can add to your online shop using WooCommerce. When adding a product, the first thing to decide is what type of product it is:

* Simple
<br/>*This is a single physical product that has no variations.*
* Virtual
<br/>*An example of this would be a service, such as hourly consulting.*
* Downloadable
<br/>*This is both virtual and downloadable, such as an ebook or a music file.*
* Grouped
<br/>*A collection of products that are related but can be purchased separately. An example would be different models of the iMac from Apple.*
* External or Affiliate
<br/>*A product your will add to your store but buyers will be sent to another site to purchase it. Affiliates work well or products you may make a commission on.*
* Variable
<br/>*Some products will have different variations and multiple images. For example a t-shirt, that comes in different sizes and colors, with different prices.*
