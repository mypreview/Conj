# Adding And Managing Products

In the process of building your webshop, you will reach a point when you will need to add some products. This should be one of the main activities in your checklist after you perform the basic configuration of your store or after you installed and activated the [Conj - eCommerce WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/conj-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/21935639?ref=mypreview).

## Product Categories

Product **categories** and **tags** work in much the same way as normal categories and tags you have when writing posts in WordPress. They can be created, edited, and selected at any time. This can be done when you first create a product or editing it.

## Product Types

There are several sorts of products that you can add to your online shop using WooCommerce. When adding a product, the first thing to decide is what type of product it is:

* **Simple**
<br/>*This is a single physical product that has no variations.*
* **Virtual**
<br/>*An example of this would be a service, such as hourly consulting.*
* **Downloadable**
<br/>*This is both virtual and downloadable, such as an ebook or a music file.*
* **Grouped**
<br/>*A collection of products that are related but can be purchased separately. An example would be different models of the iMac from Apple.*
* **External or Affiliate**
<br/>*A product your will add to your store but buyers will be sent to another site to purchase it. Affiliates work well or products you may make a commission on.*
* **Variable**
<br/>*Some products will have different variations and multiple images. For example a t-shirt, that comes in different sizes and colors, with different prices.*

?> Other types are often added by extensions. For example, [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) adds new product types as does [WooCommerce Bookings](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/).

## Adding a Simple Product

Adding a Simple product is similar to writing a post in WordPress.

Follow the steps below to publish your first WooCommerce product:

1. Login to the your WordPress Dashboard.
2. Click the **Products** tab.
3. Click the **Add New** sub-tab.
4. Enter a product **Title** and **Description**.
5. Navigate to the **Product Data** panel, and select downloadable (digital) or virtual (service) if applicable.
6. Optionally, upload a featured image for your product.
7. When you are ready, click **Publish**.

!> Note that virtual products don’t require shipping — an order with virtual products won’t calculate shipping costs.
