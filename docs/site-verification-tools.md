### Google Warnings

In case you have received an email from Google with a subject of an alert in your **Webmaster Tools** dashboard that your site’s security certificate could not be found, this means your site was inadvertently added as a secure site. 

An example of the message you may have received:

```txt
Dear Webmaster,

The host name of your site, https://example.com, does not match any of the “Subject Names” in your SSL certificate [….]
This will cause many web browsers to block users from accessing your site, or to display a security warning message when your site is accessed.

To correct this problem, please get a new SSL certificate by a Certificate Authority (CA) with a “Subject Name” or “Subject Alternative DNS Names” that matches your host name.
```

If a message like the above arrived in your inbox, you’d need to remove the site from your **Webmaster Tools** account, and then add it back as a standard site.

1. Log in to [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/) with your **Google account**.
