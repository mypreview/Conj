# Customizing Product Catalog

The **Product Catalog** options allows you to customize:

* What to display on the **Shop page**?
* What to display on **Category pages**?
* **How to sort products** in a Category?
* **How many products** to show in a single row?
* **How many rows** of products to display on a page?

## Shop Page Display

The **WooCommerce Shop Page** can display *Products*, *Categories*, or both. However, it is recommended to select only one to have a clean look.
