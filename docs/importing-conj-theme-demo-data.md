### Demo Content Import

* Navigate to **Tools** » **Import**.
* If you don’t have the [WordPress Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) plugin installed on your website, first install it by selecting **Install Now**.
* Once it’s installed select **Run Importer**.
* Choose **WordPress** from the list.
* Upload `dummy-data/content-{demo-name}.xml` from the package you downloaded from [Envato](https://themeforest.net/) then click on **Upload File** and **Import** button.
* Check or uncheck the **Download and import file attachments** checkbox.<br/>
*If checked, this will import all the sample post, page and product images to your site.*
* Click **Submit** and the plugin will now load demo content from the imported file.
