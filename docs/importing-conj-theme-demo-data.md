# Importing A Theme Demo

Right after installing a fresh copy of the [Conj - eCommerce WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/conj-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/21935639?ref=mypreview) and [required/recommended plugins](installing-recommended-plugins) you may find you have an empty store. 

There are no posts, pages, products, orders, reviews, and more by default. This is because you can get started right away creating your own products and pages along with setting up the WooCommerce settings for the needs of your store.
