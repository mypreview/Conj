# Importing dummy data 

Right after installing a fresh copy of Conj theme and [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) plugin you may find you have an empty store. There are no products, orders, reviews, and more by default. This is because you can get started right away creating your own products and setting up WooCommerce exactly for the needs of your store.

!> We do **NOT** supply the exact images you see on our demo within the dummy data as the pictures of the site cannot be redistributed due to copyright restrictions and are for demo purposes only.

In addition to the above, it is NOT recommended to take next steps forward if you have existing content in your WordPress installation, as it will add numerous posts, pages, categories, media and more to your site.
Also, try to replace all content as soon as possible to avoid adverse SEO effects or image licensing repercussions.

## Built-in demo importer

Importing the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to edit everything instead of creating content from scratch super quickly and with ease.

!> Before you begin, make sure to deactivate all 3rd party plugins except the WooCommerce which is recommended by the theme.
