<br/>*The list of selectable products is the products that are currently marked as featured at your shop. This is to avoid loading your entire product list in the Customizer. Be sure that the product you want to display in your hero component is marked as featured or it won't be selectable here. Likewise, if you don’t have any featured products, then the setting won't appear at all.*<br/>
