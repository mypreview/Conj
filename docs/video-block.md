# Video Block

The video block lets you upload and embed video into your post or page.

To add an video, click on the [Add Block](adding-block) button and select the **Video** block. Alternatively, you can start typing `/video` in a new paragraph block, then press enter.

## Block Interface

Every block comes with unique and block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block directly right in the editor.

## Adding a Video

Upon adding an video block, you will get three options to chose from: **Upload**, **Media Library**, and **Insert from URL**.

* The **Upload** button will allow you to upload a new video file from your computer. 
* The **Media Library** button lets you select a file that’s already uploaded to your site’s Media Library. 
* **Insert from URL** button lets you input a URL where the file has already been uploaded, on a streaming service such as **Youtube**, upon inserting the URL video block will automatically transform into a Youtube block.

Right after you’ve selected the audio file to insert, you can add an optional text **caption** just underneath the player and start configuring your audio block.

### Alignment

A block-specific toolbar will appear whenever you select the video block. Three of the options are for the block’s alignment, right, center, and left. Choosing the **right** or **left** will allow you to place another block alongside the video block moreover picking **center** will return the block to its default, taking up the full width of the post or page content.

If you wish for the video to be emphasized on the page, the Wide and Full Alignment options will expand the video beyond the bounding column of the page, providing a cinematic experience.
