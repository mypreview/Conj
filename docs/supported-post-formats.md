* [Link](https://www.conj.ws/electronic-store/post-format-link/): For those days when you just want to share a link to a fantastic article you read which creates a post that links to external resources right from the title.
* [Status](https://www.conj.ws/electronic-store/post-format-status/): A quick update on what you are doing right now most likely to a Twitter status update because updates are no longer reserved for social networks.
