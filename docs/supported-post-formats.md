* **Aside**: For brief snippets of text that arenâ€™t entirely whole blog posts, such as quick thoughts and anecdotes. Similar to a Facebook note update.
* **Image**: A single image. The first `<img/>` tag in the post content or uploaded featured image will be considered as an image post format.
* **Video**: A single video or video playlist. The first `<video/>` tag or embed in the post content will be considered as a video post format.
* **Quote**: A quotation. The theme would add blockquote tag to the quote content automatically if the user didn't add it.
* **Gallery**: A gallery of images. Post will likely contain a gallery shortcode and will have image attachments.
* **Audio**: An audio file of your tunes or podcasts. The first `<audio/>` tag or embed in the post content will be considered as a video post format.
* **Link**: For those days when you just want to share a link to a fantastic article you read which creates a post that links to external resources right from the title.
* **Status**: A quick update on what you are doing right now most likely to a Twitter status update because updates are no longer reserved for social networks.
* **Chat**: To highlight an interesting conversation or a chat transcript you have with friends, both on- and offline.

?> When writing or editing a post, **Standard** is used on any post that **No Post Format** is specified.
