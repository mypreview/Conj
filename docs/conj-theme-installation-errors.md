## Missing the `style.css`

This is one of the common issues that may occur when installing a WordPress theme. The following error message may appear when uploading or activating the theme.

!> The package could not be installed. The theme is missing the `style.css` stylesheet.

In most cases, the reason to receive this error is if you have uploaded the incorrect file. This is because the package that you have downloaded from ThemeForest usually includes additional files such as the documentation, dummy data, license, etc.
