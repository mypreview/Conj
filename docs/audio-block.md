# Audio Block

Creating an audio block will enable you to embed a piece of music, podcast, or any other sound file right into your page or post.

To add an audio, click on the [Add Block](adding-block) button and select the **Audio** block. Alternatively, you can start typing `/audio` in a new paragraph block, then press enter.

## Block Interface

Every block comes with unique and block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block directly right in the editor.

### Adding Files

Upon adding an audio block, you will get three options to chose from: **Upload**, **Media Library**, and **Insert from URL**.

* The **Upload** button will allow you to upload a new audio file from your computer. 
* The **Media Library** button lets you select a file that’s already uploaded to your site’s Media Library. 
* **Insert from URL** button lets you input a URL where the file has already been uploaded, on a streaming service or elsewhere on the web.

Right after you’ve selected the audio file to insert, you can add an optional text **caption** just underneath the player and start configuring your audio block.

### Alignment

A block-specific toolbar will appear whenever you select the audio block. Three of the options are for the block’s alignment, right, center, and left. Choosing the **right** or **left** will allow you to place another block alongside the audio block moreover picking **center** will return the block to its default, taking up the full width of the post or page content.

### Edit Audio

Choosing this option will allow you to select a new audio file for the block. This option can be used to replace the current audio file in the block.

## Sidebar Settings

In addition to the options found in the block’s toolbar, you may locate the block specific settings in the **editor sidebar panel**. Clicking on the **cog** icon next to the publish button will toggle the visibility of this panel.
