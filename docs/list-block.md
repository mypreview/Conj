# List Block

List block allows you to create a bulleted or numbered list and luckily organizing content into lists has just gotten easier since [WordPress version 5.0](wordpress-editor) release.

To add a cover, click on the [Add Block](adding-block) button and select the **cover** block. Alternatively, you can start typing `/cover` in a new paragraph block, then press enter.
