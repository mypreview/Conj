# List Block

List block allows you to create a bulleted or numbered list and thanks to the new [editor](wordpress-editor) of the WordPress organizing content into lists has just gotten easier.

To add a list, click on the [Add Block](adding-block) button and select the **List** block. Alternatively, you can start typing `/list` in a new paragraph block, then press enter.

## Block Toolbar

Every block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block directly in the editor.

* Numbered (ordered) list
* Outdent
* Indent
* Bold
* Italic
* Hyperlink

?> List block comes in two styles, Unordered (bulleted) and Ordered (numbered).

You can use the indent icons in the toolbar to indent your lists:

## Sidebar Settings

In addition to the options found in the blockâ€™s toolbar, you may locate the block specific settings in the **editor sidebar panel**. Clicking on the **cog** icon next to the publish button will toggle the visibility of this panel.
