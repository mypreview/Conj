# Widget regions 

WordPress Widgets add content and features to your Sidebars. The [Conj - eCommerce WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/conj-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/21935639?ref=mypreview) theme includes ten widget regions by default.

## Displaying Widgets

1. Log into your WordPress website and navigate to **Appearance** » **Widgets**.
2. Choose a **Widget** and either drag it to the sidebar where you wish it to appear, or click the widget, *(select a destination sidebar if your theme has more than one)* and click the **Add Widget** button.
3. Preview the site. You should now see the added widgets are visible.

## Arranging Widgets

To arrange the **Widgets** within the sidebar or widget area, click and **drag** it into place.

## Configuring Widgets

To customize the widget features, click the down **arrow** in the upper right corner to expand the widget’s interface. Then click the **Save** button to save the widget’s customization.

## Removing Widgets

To delete or remove the widget from the view, click **Delete**.

## Widget Visibility

This module is now enabled by default for all [JetPack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) users and enables you to configure widgets to appear only on specific pages (or be hidden on certain pages) by using the **Visibility** panel.
