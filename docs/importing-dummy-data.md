# Importing dummy data 

Right after installing a fresh copy of Conj theme and [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) plugin you may find you have an empty store. There are no products, orders, reviews, and more by default. This is because you can get started right away creating your own products and setting up WooCommerce exactly for the needs of your store.

!> Images imported within the dummy data are only for demonstration purposes which might be subjected to the copyright law and can **NOT** be used on a live site, nor redistributed.

!> Images or videos imported within the demo content are **NOT** included to your purchase. In case you are willing to use any of them on your website, you need to acquire the appropriate license.

In addition to the above, it is NOT recommended to take next steps forward if you have existing content in your WordPress installation, as it will add numerous posts, pages, categories, media and more to your site.
Also, try to replace all content as soon as possible to avoid adverse SEO effects or image licensing repercussions.
