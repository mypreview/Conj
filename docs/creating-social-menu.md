# Creating Social Network Menu

Social media icons can be displayed on your site’s top bar area. These tiny social media buttons link to services like Twitter and Facebook, allowing visitors to access your social profiles quickly.

?> The [Conj - eCommerce WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/conj-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/21935639?ref=mypreview) offers a special custom menu *(labeled Social Menu)* for adding your social media icons.

You need to define a menu before adding any social media icons to it.
